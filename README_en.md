## üöÄ Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### Prerequisites

* [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Version 6.0+ recommended)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Game Client (Compatible Version: `1.9.x`)

### Server Deployment

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/TencentDataBank/SnowbreakTC_Server.git](https://github.com/TencentDataBank/SnowbreakTC_Server.git)
    cd SnowbreakTC_Server
    ```

2.  **Configure the server**
    Copy `config.json.example` and rename it to `config.json`.
    ```bash
    cp config.json.example config.json
    ```
    Then, modify the `config.json` file according to your environment, especially the database connection string and the server's listening IP address.
    ```json
    {
      "Database": {
        "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "Name": "SnowbreakDB"
      },
      "Server": {
        "ListenIp": "0.0.0.0",
        "PublicIp": "127.0.0.1",
        "Port": 443
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Build and run**
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
    When you see the console output "Server started successfully on port 443," the server has launched successfully.

### Client Connection

You will need to use a traffic redirection tool to point the game's network requests to your private server.

1.  **Recommended Tools**: `Fiddler`, `Mitmproxy`, or other network debugging proxy tools.
2.  **Redirection Rule**: Redirect all traffic from `*.seasungames.com` (this is an example; the specific domain may need to be confirmed via packet capture) to your server's `PublicIp`.
3.  Launch the game client. If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to connect to your server, create an account, and enter the game.
